## Edit #1 — Tempo Correction

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `132` or `BPM` or `tempo`

### Exact Text to Highlight

> So What is typically performed at approximately 132 BPM

*(Highlight the sentence containing "132 BPM" or whatever tempo figure
the article states.)*

### Replacement Text

> So What is typically performed at approximately 136–138 BPM. The Kind
> of Blue recording (March 2, 1959) runs at approximately 136–138 BPM.
> Jazz musicians often play it in a range of 126–144 BPM depending on
> interpretation, with the Miles Davis studio recording at the faster end
> of the medium swing range.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

132 BPM is slightly below the actual tempo of the Kind of Blue recording.
For a tune primarily known through that recording, citing a tempo 4-6 BPM
lower than the source can mislead musicians trying to practice at the
"correct" speed. This is a minor but correctable imprecision.

## Edit #2 — Scale/Mode Enhancement (Addition, Not Correction)

### Text to Add

In the harmonic analysis section, after the description of D Dorian:

> D Dorian differs from D natural minor (D Aeolian) by one note: the
> natural sixth (B natural vs Bb). This characteristic natural sixth
> gives Dorian its brighter, less resolved quality compared to Aeolian,
> and is the note most associated with the modal jazz sound on So What.
> The bridge raises everything by a half step to Eb Dorian (Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb–C–Db),
> creating a subtle but unmistakable shift that many listeners describe
> as a temporary "brightening" or "awakening."

## Notes

The Grokipedia article on So What is notably strong — the existing coverage
of the quartal "So What chord" voicing, the George Russell influence,
and the solo structure is accurate. Our contribution here is refinement
rather than correction. Submit Edit #1 (tempo) as a clean factual fix;
Edit #2 is an optional enhancement.
