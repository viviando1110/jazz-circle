## Edit #1 — Bridge Chord Description

### How to Find the Text

On the article page, use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for:
`III7–VI7–II7–V7`
or search for:
`bridge` and look for the section describing the B section harmony.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The bridge employs a III7–VI7–II7–V7 progression (D7–G7–C7–F7) cycling
> through dominant seventh chords before returning to the tonic.

*(Note: The exact wording may vary slightly — highlight the sentence or
phrase that describes the bridge as containing only dominant seventh chords,
specifically mentioning D7, G7, C7, F7 without the preceding minor 7th chords.)*

### Replacement Text

> The bridge uses four ii-V pairs, each spanning two bars:
> Am7→D7 (bars 17–18), Dm7→G7 (bars 19–20), Gm7→C7 (bars 21–22),
> Cm7→F7 (bars 23–24). Each dominant seventh chord is preceded by its
> related minor seventh chord — the current description omits these and
> presents the bridge as a dominant-only chain, which is incorrect.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

The bridge of Anthropology follows the same ii-V structure used in all
rhythm changes: each dominant is preceded by its ii chord. Omitting the
minor sevenths is a significant error that would mislead any musician
trying to learn or transcribe the tune.

## Edit #2 — A Section Turnaround Description

### Exact Text to Highlight

Search for: `Bb7-Eb7-G7-Cm7` or `turnaround` near the A section description.

> The A sections feature a turnaround of Bb7–Eb7–G7–Cm7

### Replacement Text

> The A sections open in Bb major and move through a series of ii-V
> progressions: Bbmaj7→Gm7/C7→Cm7/F7→Bbmaj7/Bb7→Ebmaj7→Ebm7/Ab7→
> Dm7/G7→Cm7/F7. This is the standard rhythm changes A section structure
> shared by dozens of bebop contrafacts.

## Notes

Anthropology is a direct contrafact on Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm" (rhythm changes).
The bridge structure (four ii-V pairs) is one of the most documented elements
of rhythm changes — every jazz education resource confirms the ii-V pairs.
This is our strongest correction candidate.
