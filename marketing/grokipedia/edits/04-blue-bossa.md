# Grokipedia Edit — Blue Bossa (Kenny Dorham)

**Priority:** 🔴 High — Form label contradicts the chord listing in same article

## Edit #1 — Form Label Error (Internal Contradiction)

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `AABA` or `32-bar`
Look for the educational or theory section describing the form.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> Blue Bossa features a straightforward 32-bar AABA form

*(Highlight "32-bar AABA form" or the full sentence containing it.)*

### Replacement Text

> Blue Bossa is a 16-bar AB form: an 8-bar A section in C minor followed
> by an 8-bar B section (bridge) in Db major. The head is typically
> played twice, giving a 32-bar performance, which may be the source
> of the "32-bar" description — but the composition itself is 16 bars,
> and AABA is incorrect since there is no return to the A section material
> within the form; it simply moves A→B→repeat.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

The article's own chord listing shows 16 bars of music (8 bars C minor,
8 bars Db major). The "32-bar AABA" label in the same article directly
contradicts this listing — an internal consistency error that is verifiable
without any external source. Blue Bossa's 16-bar AB form is documented
in every lead sheet and jazz education resource.

## Edit #2 — Scale/Key Center Enhancement (Optional)

### Replacement Text to Add

After the chord listing, add:

> The Db major bridge creates a striking harmonic color because Db
> sits a half step above C, rather than being the relative major of
> C minor (which would be Eb major). This bII relationship — sometimes
> called a Neapolitan motion — gives the bridge its characteristic
> brightness against the minor A section.

## Notes

This is the strongest "internal contradiction" case — we don't need to
cite any external source, just point to the inconsistency within the
article itself. Grokipedia's review AI should be able to verify this
by simply reading the article's own chord listing (16 bars) vs. form
claim (32-bar AABA).
