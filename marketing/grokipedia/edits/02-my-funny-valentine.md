## Edit #1 — Key of B Section (Eb vs Ab)

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `E-flat major` or `Eb major`
Look for the sentence describing the modulation in the B section.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The song is set in C minor with modulations to E-flat major in the
> middle sections before returning to the tonic.

*(Highlight the phrase "modulations to E-flat major" or the full sentence
containing the key claim for the B section.)*

### Replacement Text

> The song is set in C minor. The B section (bars 17–24) moves to
> Ab major — not Eb major — centered on Abmaj7. This is a movement
> to the submediant (bVI) of C minor, a characteristic harmonic color
> in the tune. The final A section returns to C minor.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

Eb major is the relative major of C minor and a common assumption,
but the actual B section harmony centers on Abmaj7. Any lead sheet
or published arrangement confirms Ab major as the B section key.
This error would cause a musician to play entirely wrong chord choices
in the middle eight bars.

## Edit #2 — Form Description

### How to Find the Text

Search for: `AABA` near "form" or "structure."

### Exact Text to Highlight

> My Funny Valentine is a 32-bar AABA standard

*(Highlight any reference to AABA form — the actual form is closer to
ABAB or AABB depending on the lead sheet edition, and importantly the
B section is not a traditional "bridge" that contrasts with the A — it
extends the minor harmonic world.)*

### Replacement Text

> My Funny Valentine follows a 36-bar form (in most jazz lead sheet
> editions). The sections are often labeled ABAB: two A sections (C minor,
> 8 bars each) alternate with two B sections (Ab major, 8 bars each),
> with a short coda. Some editions present it as 32 bars; the exact bar
> count varies by arrangement.

## Notes

The Eb major error is the most actionable correction here —
it's verifiable against any published lead sheet and clearly wrong.
The form correction is secondary and may be more debated.
Submit Edit #1 first; submit Edit #2 separately if #1 is approved.
