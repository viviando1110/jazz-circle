## Edit #1 — Bridge Description Error ("Cycle of Fourths" Claim)

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for:
`ascending perfect fourths` or `cycle of fifths` near `bridge`

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The bridge features an extended cycle of fifths progressing through
> multiple key centers with ascending perfect fourths

*(Highlight the sentence describing the bridge as a cycle of fourths/fifths.)*

### Replacement Text

> The bridge (bars 19–26) contains two ii-V-I progressions in unrelated
> keys: Am7–D7–Gmaj7 (resolving to G major) and C#m7–F#7–Emaj7
> (resolving to E major). These are not a cycle of fourths — they are
> two discrete ii-V-I cadences a major third apart, consistent with the
> broader structure of the tune which cycles through key centers related
> by major thirds (Ab, C, Eb, G, E).

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

"Cycle of fourths with ascending perfect fourths" describes a different
harmonic motion (e.g., C→F→Bb→Eb) than what actually occurs in the bridge.
The bridge uses two isolated ii-V-I progressions; calling this a cycle of
fourths mischaracterizes the harmonic structure and would cause a musician
to approach the bridge with the wrong mental model.

## Edit #2 — Key Center Map Clarification

### How to Find the Text

Search for: `A-flat, C, E-flat, G, and E` or the list of key centers visited.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The song modulates through successive tonal centers — A-flat, C,
> E-flat, G, and E major

### Replacement Text

> All The Things You Are cycles through four tonal areas, each approached
> by a ii-V progression: Ab major (A1 section, bars 1–8), C major (brief
> passing, bars 9–10), Eb major (A2 section, bars 11–18), G major and
> E major (bridge, bars 19–26), then a chromatic tag through Db major
> before returning to Ab major (final A, bars 27–36). The key areas are
> not visited "successively" in a linear chain — the tune begins and ends
> in Ab major with the other centers as a journey outward and back.
