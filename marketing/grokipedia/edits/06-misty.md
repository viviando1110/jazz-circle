# Grokipedia Edit — Misty (Erroll Garner)

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium — Geographically impossible claim

## Edit #1 — Geography Error (Flight Route)

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `San Francisco` or `Chicago` or `flight`

### Exact Text to Highlight

> Erroll Garner composed Misty after being inspired by clouds he observed
> during a flight from San Francisco to Chicago

*(Highlight "flight from San Francisco to Chicago" or the full sentence
containing this claim.)*

### Replacement Text

> Erroll Garner composed Misty after being inspired by mist and clouds
> he observed from an airplane window. Garner's own accounts describe
> looking out at the clouds during a flight and being moved to compose
> the melody. The specific route cited in some sources ("San Francisco
> to Chicago") is geographically incorrect as that domestic route does
> not cross the Pacific Ocean; Garner's accounts refer to clouds and
> mist without specifying a route that would be consistent with a Pacific
> crossing.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

San Francisco to Chicago is a continental US domestic route that travels
east over land, not over the Pacific Ocean. Garner's composition story
involves observing mist over water (Pacific Ocean). The "SF to Chicago"
route appears to be an AI synthesis error combining two separate details
from different sources. The correction does not remove the flight/mist
origin story — only corrects the geographically impossible route claim.

### Source Citation

General: Garner's composition story is documented in multiple biographies
and interviews without specifying the SF-Chicago route.

## Edit #2 — Harmonic Description Enhancement (Optional)

### Text to Add

After the description of the chord structure, add:

> A notable harmonic feature of Misty is the borrowed iv chord in bar 5:
> Abm7 (the minor subdominant in Eb major). This chord, followed by Db7,
> creates a brief moment of minor-key color that contributes significantly
> to the tune's melancholic character. The bridge features two distinct
> ii-V-I progressions in unrelated keys (Bbm7–Eb7–Abmaj7, then Am7–D7–Gmaj7),
> an unusual harmonic journey for a 32-bar standard.

## Notes

The geography error (Edit #1) is the priority — it's factually verifiable
with basic geography knowledge. Edit #2 adds value but is an enhancement
rather than a correction; submit separately after #1 is processed.
