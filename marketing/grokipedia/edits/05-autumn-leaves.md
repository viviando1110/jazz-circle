## Edit #1 — E Minor vs G Minor Key Confusion

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `Em` or `E minor` near chord descriptions.
Look for the section describing the chord progression where both
E minor and G minor chord symbols appear without clarification.

### Exact Text to Highlight

Look for a passage such as:

> Em | EmMaj7 | Em7 | A7...

or any chord listing that uses E as the tonal center without
clarifying this is the original French key, not the jazz performance standard.

*(Highlight the chord listing section and/or any sentence that presents
chords in E minor as "the" progression without clarifying the key.)*

### Replacement Text

> Autumn Leaves was originally composed in E minor (in the 1945 French
> song "Les Feuilles Mortes"). However, jazz musicians universally perform
> the standard in G minor, which has become the default key in jazz lead
> sheets and fake books. The standard jazz progression in G minor is:
> Cm7–F7–Bbmaj7–Ebmaj7–Am7b5–D7–Gm7 (A section), with the bridge
> reversing the circle-of-fourths motion. Stating chords in E minor
> without this clarification is misleading to jazz learners.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

The two keys (E minor original, G minor jazz standard) produce entirely
different chord symbols. A learner reading the E minor chord listing and
trying to play with recordings or a rhythm section will be a minor third
off on every chord. This distinction — not just a footnote but the central
practical fact about this tune — is absent from the current article.

## Edit #2 — Form Label

### Exact Text to Highlight

Search for: `AABC` or any description of the form structure.

### Replacement Text

> Autumn Leaves follows an AABA form (32 bars) in jazz lead sheet editions.
> Some sources label the sections differently (AABC) depending on how the
> bridge and final A section are distinguished. The jazz performance standard
> is AABA with a 16-bar A section (8 bars + 8 bars), an 8-bar bridge (B),
> and an 8-bar final A.

## Notes

Edit #1 (key clarification) is high value — the G minor vs E minor
distinction is the single most practically important fact about this tune
for any musician. Submit this first. The form label edit is secondary.
