## Edit #1 — Amy Winehouse Fabricated Recording

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `Winehouse` or `Frank`

### Exact Text to Highlight

> Amy Winehouse recorded a version of 'Round Midnight as a B-side
> from her album Frank (2003)

*(Highlight the full sentence or phrase making this claim.)*

### Replacement Text

> [Delete this sentence entirely — no verified source confirms Amy
> Winehouse recorded 'Round Midnight as a Frank B-side or in any
> other documented context.]

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

Amy Winehouse's album Frank (2003) and its known B-sides are well-documented.
'Round Midnight does not appear in any verified Winehouse discography,
B-side listing, or session documentation. This appears to be an AI-generated
fabrication. Removing unverified claims is consistent with Grokipedia's
stated accuracy standards.

### Source Citation

No source needed for a deletion — cite absence of evidence:
"Not found in any verified Winehouse discography. See official Island
Records discography and AllMusic entry for Frank."

## Edit #2 — Bridge Harmonic Description (Enhancement)

### How to Find the Text

Search for `bridge` near chord description.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> progressing from E-flat minor seventh to A-flat seventh, then
> D-flat minor seventh to G-flat seventh

*(This is an incomplete description of the A section — look for the
sentence that describes the full progression and only mentions 2-3 chords.)*

### Replacement Text

> The A section moves through Ebm7→Eb7→Abmaj7, with Cm7b5 and F7b9
> playing a central role — the half-diminished and flat-ninth chord
> combination is a defining harmonic signature of Monk's composition.
> The bridge descends through three ii-V-I progressions: Dbmaj7 area,
> Cmaj7 area, and Bbmaj7 area, stepping down by whole steps before
> returning to Eb minor.

## Notes

The Winehouse deletion is the priority — it's a clean, documentable
error that Grokipedia's AI should be able to verify against its own
training data. The harmonic enhancement (Edit #2) is secondary.
Submit separately.
