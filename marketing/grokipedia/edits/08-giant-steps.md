## Edit #1 — Recording Personnel Clarification

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `Wynton Kelly` or `Jimmy Cobb`

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The recording features Tommy Flanagan, Paul Chambers, Art Taylor
> on four tracks, and Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb on
> the other three

*(This describes the full Giant Steps album, not the specific
"Giant Steps" composition track. Highlight this sentence.)*

### Replacement Text

> The composition "Giant Steps" was recorded with pianist Tommy Flanagan,
> bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Art Taylor. Flanagan has documented
> the difficulty of improvising over the changes at sight — his solo on
> the recording shows hesitation at the rapid key center changes, which
> Coltrane later acknowledged. The other personnel listed (Wynton Kelly,
> Jimmy Cobb) appear on other tracks of the Giant Steps album but not
> on the title composition.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

Attributing multiple personnel groupings to the composition itself (rather
than the album) creates an inaccurate impression of who plays on "Giant Steps"
the track. Flanagan/Chambers/Taylor is the documented personnel for this
specific recording.

## Edit #2 — Bar-by-Bar Chord Notation (Enhancement)

### Text to Add

In the harmonic analysis section:

> The 16-bar form divides into two 8-bar sections. The first section
> (bars 1–8): Bmaj7–D7–Gmaj7–Bb7–Ebmaj7–Am7–D7–Gmaj7.
> The second section (bars 9–16): Bb7–Ebmaj7–F#m7–B7–Emaj7–C#m7–F#7–Bmaj7.
> Each tonal center (B major, G major, Eb major) is approached by its
> dominant seventh chord, creating the characteristic "Coltrane changes"
> pattern of symmetric major-third motion.

## Notes

The Giant Steps article is otherwise excellent — Coltrane changes,
Slonimsky influence, Grammy Hall of Fame, Flanagan's documented difficulty
are all correctly covered. Our contribution here is a factual precision
fix (Edit #1) and a concrete harmonic addition (Edit #2).
Submit Edit #1 first as it's a clear correction.
