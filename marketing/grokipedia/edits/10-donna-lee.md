## Edit #1 — B Section Vague Description

### How to Find the Text

Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F and search for: `Db major` or `secondary dominants`
near the B section description.

### Exact Text to Highlight

> The B section shifts to Db major before cycling through secondary
> dominants back to the home key of Ab major

*(Highlight the full sentence describing the B section.)*

### Replacement Text

> The B section moves through a series of chromatic ii-V progressions
> descending by half steps: Dm7–G7 (toward C major), Cm7–F7 (toward
> Bb major), then Am7–D7–Abm7–Db7–Gm7–C7–Fm7–Bb7 in rapid succession,
> each ii-V pair lasting one bar at bebop tempos. This compressed chromatic
> chain — not a shift to Db major — is the defining bebop challenge of
> Donna Lee and requires precise execution at the 240–280 BPM tempos
> at which the tune is typically performed.

### Reason to Include in Submission Notes

Describing the B section as "shifting to Db major" misidentifies the
harmonic motion. The B section is a series of chromatic ii-V pairs,
not a tonal center on Db. A musician reading this description would
prepare for a Db tonic when the actual requirement is navigating a
fast chromatic ii-V chain. This is the most practically important fact
about the tune's difficulty.

## Edit #2 — Tempo Context Addition

### Text to Add

In the performance notes section:

> Donna Lee is typically performed at 240–280 BPM, placing it among
> the most technically demanding bebop heads. At these tempos, the
> chromatic ii-V pairs in the B section last less than half a second
> each. Miles Davis's 1947 recording with the Charlie Parker Quintet
> runs at approximately 256 BPM.

## Notes

The Donna Lee article has reasonable coverage of the historical
attribution dispute and the Indiana contrafact origin, both of which
are correct. Our contribution here is practical: the B section
description and tempo context are the most useful additions for a
musician learning the tune.
