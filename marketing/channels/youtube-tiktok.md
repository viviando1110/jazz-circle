# YouTube Shorts & TikTok — Strategy

## Status: ⏳ Planned — Launch After iOS App Ships

Rationale: iOS app gives us a better story ("free on web, premium on iOS")
and higher production urgency. Video content will drive App Store discovery
as well as web traffic.

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Learn [Standard] in 60 Seconds" (screen record)
- Record the jazz-circle.com chord chart + notation while playing along on piano
- Show bar highlights syncing with playback
- Caption: "Here's how [Standard] works harmonically"
- Zero post-production — just screen record + audio

### Pillar 2: "Why [Standard] Is [Hard/Beautiful/Weird]" (explainer)
- Giant Steps: why major-third jumps break normal ii-V-I logic
- Autumn Leaves: why two ii-V-Is back to back feel so inevitable
- Misty: why the borrowed iv chord (Abm7) creates that melancholy color
- Donna Lee: why it's a contrafact on Indiana and how that works

### Pillar 3: "I Built This" (product demo)
- "I built a site that shows you every jazz standard's chord changes for free"
- Demo the circle, click into a standard, show the notation + playback
- Natural hook: musicians will share it

### Pillar 4: "Jazz Theory Facts" (short, shareable)
- "The 3 chords that appear in 80% of jazz standards" (ii-V-I)
- "Why Coltrane changes work" (symmetric major-third cycles)
- "The chord that makes Misty sound sad" (Abm7 borrowed iv)
- "Modal jazz explained in 30 seconds" (So What — 2 chords for the whole form)

## Platform Differences

| Format | YouTube Shorts | TikTok |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Length | 15-60 sec | 15-60 sec |
| Hook timing | First 3 sec | First 1 sec |
| Best for | Discovery + SEO longtail | Virality + music community |
| Jazz community | Smaller but loyal | Growing fast (#jazztheory) |
| Link in bio | Yes | Yes |

## Production Requirements

- Piano (already have)
- Screen recording software (QuickTime on Mac — free)
- Basic video editor for captions (CapCut — free)
- Consistent branding: Jazz Circle logo + jazz-circle.com URL in corner

## SEO Value of YouTube

YouTube is the second-largest search engine. "Autumn Leaves chord changes"
and "Giant Steps explained" are regularly searched on YouTube.
A video ranking for those terms with a link to jazz-circle.com in the
description drives qualified traffic.

## Hashtags to Target
