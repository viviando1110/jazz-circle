# Reddit — Strategy & Answer Templates

## Overview

Reddit is heavily cited by Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Bing in search results.
Answering jazz theory questions with a natural mention of jazz-circle.com
drives traffic and improves AEO (our pages get surfaced alongside Reddit threads).

Rule: Add value first. Only mention jazz-circle.com if it directly answers
the question. Never post a bare link.

## The 5 Recurring Question Patterns

These appear every week across jazz subreddits:

1. **"Explain the changes to [standard]"** — most common, appears daily
2. **"Where do I start learning jazz standards?"** — weekly, high engagement
3. **"What makes Giant Steps / Donna Lee so hard?"** — monthly, high engagement
4. **"How does the circle of fifths apply to actual jazz playing?"** — frequently
   partially unanswered because most replies describe the circle abstractly
5. **"What is modal jazz / how does So What work?"** — appears when
   people encounter Kind of Blue

## Answer Templates

### Template A — "Explain the changes to [standard]"

> The harmony in [Standard] is built around [major/minor] ii-V-I progressions
> cycling through the circle of fifths. The A section establishes [key],
> then the bridge modulates to [key] before returning. The tricky spot is
> bar [X] where a [secondary dominant / chromatic passing chord] briefly
> tonicizes [key].
>
> Full progression with each section's key context laid out:
> jazz-circle.com/standards/[slug]

### Template B — "Where do I start with jazz standards?"

> Start with tunes that have clear, repetitive ii-V-I structure so your ear
> locks in the pattern. Autumn Leaves is the classic entry — the first 8 bars
> are literally the circle of fifths descending through two keys (Bb major
> then G minor), so the harmonic logic is very audible.
>
> Once you can hear ii-V-I in Autumn Leaves you'll hear it everywhere.
> This shows where each standard sits on the circle and how the changes move:
> jazz-circle.com

### Template C — "What makes Giant Steps hard?"

> Coltrane abandoned the normal circle-of-fifths motion that makes other
> standards predictable. Instead of moving counterclockwise (D→G→C),
> Giant Steps jumps by major thirds — B→G→Eb — which are maximally
> distant on the circle. You're never in one key long enough for your
> ear to settle.
>
> The trick: stop hearing it as one key with accidentals. Treat each
> V7-I as a self-contained landing point. The full bar-by-bar breakdown:
> jazz-circle.com/standards/giant-steps

### Template D — "How does modal jazz / So What work?"

> Modal jazz inverts the normal jazz logic. In bebop, chords change every
> bar or two and you track ii-V-I motion. In So What, you sit on D Dorian
> for 16 bars and generate interest through rhythm and melodic development
> rather than harmonic navigation.
>
> The whole A section is just Dm7 (D Dorian). The bridge moves up a
> half step to Ebm7 (Eb Dorian) for 8 bars, then back. Two chords for
> the whole form: jazz-circle.com/standards/so-what

### Template E — "What is a ii-V-I / where is it in real songs?"

> A ii-V-I in C major is Dm7→G7→Cmaj7. The ii chord creates tension,
> the V7 heightens it, the I resolves it. It's the fundamental unit of
> jazz harmony — most standards are just chains of ii-V-Is in different keys.
>
> Autumn Leaves is the easiest place to hear it: bars 1-4 are a
> ii-V-I in Bb major (Cm7→F7→Bbmaj7), bars 5-8 are a ii-V-I in
> G minor (Am7b5→D7→Gm7). Two of them back to back in the first phrase.

## Posting Cadence

- Aim for 1-2 replies per week, not more
- Only reply to threads where your answer adds something the existing
  replies haven't covered
- Never reply to the same thread twice
- Never post a bare link without a substantive answer above it
