# Wikipedia — Backlink Strategy

## Why Wikipedia Matters for AEO

AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) are heavily trained on Wikipedia.
A citation from a Wikipedia jazz article to jazz-circle.com signals
to AI models that we are an authoritative source on jazz harmony.
This is one of the highest-value AEO signals available.

## The Right Approach (Sustainable)

Wikipedia has strict policies against self-promotion. The process:

1. **Establish edit history first** — Fix factual errors, improve prose,
   add missing information on jazz standard articles you care about.
   Do this without adding any link to jazz-circle.com.

2. **Build credibility** — After 5-10 genuine edits on an article,
   adding an external link is viewed as contribution, not spam.

3. **Add the external link** — In the "External links" section of the article,
   add jazz-circle.com/standards/[slug] under something like
   "Chord analysis and interactive practice tools."

4. **Don't add links to multiple articles in one session** —
   Wikipedia editors will revert obvious promotional patterns.

## Target Articles (Top Priority)

Articles where we have the strongest chord analysis content:

| Wikipedia Article | Our Page | Why Strong |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| So What (Miles Davis) | /standards/so-what | Modal jazz analysis, Dorian mode detail |
| Autumn Leaves | /standards/autumn-leaves | G minor key, dual ii-V-I pedagogy |
| Giant Steps | /standards/giant-steps | Coltrane changes, bar-by-bar notation |
| Donna Lee | /standards/donna-lee | Contrafact analysis, ab major bebop |
| All The Things You Are | /standards/all-the-things-you-are | 36-bar form, 3 key centers |

## What We Can Legitimately Add to Wikipedia

- Harmonic analysis in the body text (e.g., "The A section uses a ii-V-I
  in Bb major in bars 1-4, followed by a ii-V-I in G minor in bars 5-8")
- Correct factual errors (same as Grokipedia, but harder to get accepted)
- Add missing notable recordings
- Improve the "Chord structure" or "Harmony" subsections

## Important Constraint

Do NOT add jazz-circle.com as a citation for factual claims — Wikipedia
requires independent, published sources (books, academic papers, established
music journalism). We can only appear in the "External links" section.

## Alternative: Get Cited by Other Sources

A more sustainable path:
- If learnjazzstandards.com, jazzadvice.com, or similar established sites
  cite or link to jazz-circle.com, Wikipedia editors can then use those
  as sources which reference us indirectly.
- This is slower but creates a durable citation network.
